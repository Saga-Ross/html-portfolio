<h1>The Best Movies According to Saga</h1>
<h2>My top 3 movies of all-time.</h2>

<hr/>

<h3>Lord of the Rings: Fellowship of the Ring</h3>
<p>Easily one of the most iconic movies and led to the greatest trilogy of all-time.</p>

<h3>Howls Moving Castle</h3>
<p>One of Miyazakis greatest works and while appreciated amoungst fans, I believe it is not as well known as it should be.</p>

<h3>Superman (2025)</h3>
<p>The most recent interpretation of Superman brought me back to my childhood. For sure it must be included on this list.</p>
